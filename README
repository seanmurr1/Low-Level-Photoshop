This project is a simplified command line driven version of photoshop. By making different commmands from the command prompt, you can manipulate your image in a 
multitude of ways. The functionality included in this program is the following: 1) Change Exposure 2) Image Blending 3) Zoom Out 4) Zoom In 5) Swirl 6) Pointilism
7) Image Blurring. Most of these functions give you additional control through user-defined paramaters. The program was built to handle files of type .ppm.

In general, the program is interfaced with by entering the following into the command prompt.

"Program file name" "Input image name" "Output file name" "Function name" ("Additional paramaters")

The functions take the following paramaters.

1) Exposure - EV value (between -3 and 3)
2) Blend - Second image file name (this is the image that the initial image will be blended with), blend ratio (between 0 and 1)
3) Zoom In - No additional paramaters. Will result in 4x zoom.
4) Zoom out - No additional parameters. Will result in 0.25x zoom.
5) Swirl - X coordinate of swirl center, Y coordinate of swirl center, Swirl Strength > 0
6) Pointilism - No additional paramaters. 
7) Blur - Blur Strength > 0
